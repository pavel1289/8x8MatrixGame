Cross the road

How to play?
Move the joystick to take a step forward, backward, to left or to right.
In order to score one point, one has to safely cross the road and advance to the next one. The blinking led represents the player's position.
Worth of mentioning is that the player can only walk where there are no buildings or cars at that moment of time, thus he can't commit suicide.
